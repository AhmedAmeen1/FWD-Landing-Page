## Instructions

I modified the static skeleton that was provided by Udacity 

i added one more section (section 4) to the html as well as adding a link to google fonts to appear a 'ScrollToTop' button

my first javascript function is addSections and i used it to iterate on sections after converting it to an array , so i made that it indicates the number of sections added dynamically , make a li for each , and name each section with its ID and appending it to the navbar

Second JS function was to check the active section that is being viewed and add the active class (which was provided to us in the css file) and add that class to the active 

and at the end i put a scrolltotop button
